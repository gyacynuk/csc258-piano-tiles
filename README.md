# CSC258 - Piano Tiles Project
A remake of the classic mobile game "Piano Tiles", encoded as circuitry. The game is played with the built-in buttons on an FPGA board, and outputs a graphical display to a computer moniter via a VGA cable. 

Project was for CSC258 - Computer Organization, at the University of Toronto.
